            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <h4>Broadway Bridges’ goal is straight-forward:</h4>
            <h4>Give every New York City public high school student the chance to see a Broadway show before graduation.</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Broadway Bridges is an initiative from The Broadway League, the national trade association for the Broadway industry. Other League programs like The Jimmy Awards (The National High School Musical Theatre Awards), Family First Nights, Careers.Broadway and the High School Broadway Shadowing Program all work to bring new Broadway audiences and cultivate the talents of those who will someday work both on its stages and behind the scenes. Broadway Bridges, which is mounted in partnership with New York City Department of Education’s Office of Arts and Special Projects and the United Federation of Teachers, builds on these efforts and represents Broadway’s commitment to New York City, its students, and Broadway’s future audience and workforce.</p>

            <h2 class="red-title">Working Together</h2>
            <p>Thousands of New York City public school students participate in high-quality theatre arts programs through the Department of Education Office of Arts and Special Projects (OASP) as well as not-for-profit theatre and arts organizations. Still, there are more than one million students enrolled in New York City schools and many will graduate without having attended a Broadway show. Working in a close partnership with DOE’s OASP, Broadway Bridges supports the work of the theatre arts programs already in schools and enriches the performing arts experience for all students by bringing tenth graders to Broadway. In reaching out to an entire grade, we will eventually give every student the chance to see live, professional theatre through an annual trip to Broadway that students and teachers can look forward to each school year.</p>
