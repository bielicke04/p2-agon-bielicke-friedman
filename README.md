To do list:

1. Manny aiming to work on HTML and CSS sunday lunchtime, do not expect to finish
2. Abigail, please send illustrator or photoshop file so we won't have to recreate buttons, etc., one of us can then add to images file
3. gitignore file - we will need one and add .DS-Store to it
4. Manny to figure out drop down menu for weather API (more of a reminder for myself as we talked about it on our call)
