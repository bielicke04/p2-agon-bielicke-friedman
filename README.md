To do list:

1. Manny - sticky nav bar (form for name, school) no longer sticking
2. James â€“ work on rest of Media Queries for "Shows" page
3. Abigail - about page, ad for weather app and link it to James or Manny's weather widget
4. Abigail, remind me to ask you how you got your terminal to look so pretty. - E

Open items:
1. Weather Widget and API requirement, does localstorage count, waiting on answer from Lee.
2. James, my google fonts returned an error when I tried to validate. When I tried to copy yours, I realized you were using a different font family. Let me know how you want to move forward on this. I might need to update my google fonts code anyway. 

Completed:
* Images and mock ups saved to repo
* gitignore file - we will need one and add .DS-Store to it
* Pizza pop-up for "Shows" page
