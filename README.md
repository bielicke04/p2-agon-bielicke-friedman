To do list:

1. Manny - need to work on hamburger on friday. Nav Bar formatting. White space below the footer. 
2. James â€“ work on rest of Media Queries for "Shows" page
3. Abigail - about page, ad for weather app and link it to James or Manny's weather widget
4. Abigail, remind me to ask you how you got your terminal to look so pretty. - E

Things I need help with:
1. James, can you copy the code for the buttons to the home page buttons, please? I had trouble with the read more button that I just added to get it to center too. Also, mimic the before|after on the menu items, you have a vertical line on the mock-up, think we can figure that out in CSS? - E
2. The slider is not perfect and 2 of the slides are flipped (which would be fine if it was closer to half and half so it seemed more intentional). Y'all are welcome to take a stab at it. - E

Completed:

* Images and mock ups saved to repo
* gitignore file - we will need one and add .DS-Store to it
* Pizza pop-up for "Shows" page
