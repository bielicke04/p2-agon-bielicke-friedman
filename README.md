To do list:

1. Manny - slider, hamburger menu, added local storage to sticky header, but i still need to style and test, we might have randomizer and not a slider for the quotes, i lost some work (saved something and i could not get the old version back)
2. James â€“ work on rest of Media Queries for "Shows" page
3. Abigail - about page, ad for weather app and link it to James or Manny's weather widget
4. Abigail, remind me to ask you how you got your terminal to look so pretty. - E

Things I need help with:
1. James, can you copy the code for the buttons to the home page buttons, please? Also, mimic the before|after on the menu items, you have a vertical line on the mock-up, think we can figure that out in CSS? - E

Completed:

* Images and mock ups saved to repo
* gitignore file - we will need one and add .DS-Store to it
* Pizza pop-up for "Shows" page
